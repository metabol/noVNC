# noVNC API

The interface of the noVNC client consists of a single RFB object that
is instantiated once per connection.

## RFB

The `RFB` object represents a single connection to a VNC server. It
communicates using a WebSocket that must provide a standard RFB
protocol stream.

### Constructor

[`RFB()`](#rfb-1)
  - Creates and returns a new `RFB` object.

### Properties

`localCursor`
  - Is a `boolean` indicating if a client side cursor should be
    requested. Disabled by default.

`viewOnly`
  - Is a `boolean` indicating if any events (e.g. key presses or mouse
    movement) should be prevented from being sent to the server.
    Disabled by default.

`touchButton`
  - Is a `long` controlling the button mask that should be simulated
    when a touch event is recieved. Uses the same values as
    [`MouseEvent.button`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/button).
    Is set to `1` by default.

`scale`
  - Is a `double` indicating how the framebuffer contents should be
    scaled before being rendered on to the canvas. See also
    [`RFB.autoscale()`](#rfbautoscale). Is set to `1.0` by default.

`viewport`
  - Is a `boolean` indicating if the canvas should be clipped to its
    container. When disabled the container must be able to handle the
    resulting overflow. Disabled by default.

`viewportDrag`
  - Is a `boolean` indicating if mouse events should control the
    relative position of a clipped canvas. Only relevant if `viewport`
    is enabled. Disabled by default.

`disconnectTimeout`
  - Is a `long` indicating how many seconds to wait for a disconnect
    request to complete. Is set to `3` by default.

`capabilities` *Read only*
  - Is an `Object` indicating which optional extensions are available
    on the server. Some methods may only be called if the corresponding
    capability is set. The following capabilities are defined:

    | name     | type      | description
    | -------- | --------- | -----------
    | `power`  | `boolean` | Machine power control is available
    | `resize` | `boolean` | The framebuffer can be resized

### Event handlers

[`RFB.onupdatestate()`](#rfbonupdatestate)
  - An event handler called when the connection state of the `RFB`
    object changes.

[`RFB.onnotification()`](#rfbonnotification)
  - An event handler called when the `RFB` usage has a message to
    display to the user.

  - An event handler called when the `RFB` object disconnects.

[`RFB.oncredentials()`](#rfboncredentials)
  - An event hander called when more credentials must be given to
    continue.

[`RFB.onclipboard()`](#rfbonclipboard)
  - An event handler called when clipboard data is received from the
    server.

  - An event handler called when a audible bell request is received
    from the server.

### Details

#### RFB()

The `RFB()` constructor returns a new `RFB` object. The object will
initially be disconnected and [`RFB.connect()`](#rfbconnect) must be
called before the object will be useful.

##### Syntax

    var rfb = new RFB( target );

###### Parameters

**`target`**
  - A [`HTMLCanvasElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement)
    that specifies where graphics should be rendered and input events
    should be monitored.

#### RFB.onupdatestate

The `onupdatestate` event handler is fired after the noVNC connection
state changes. Here is a list of the states that are reported:

| connection state  | description
| ----------------- | ------------
| `"connecting"`    | starting to connect
| `"connected"`     | connected normally
| `"disconnecting"` | starting to disconnect
| `"disconnected"`  | disconnected

Note that a `RFB` objects can not transition from the disconnected
state in any way, a new instance of the object has to be created for
new connections.

##### Syntax

    RFB.onupdatestate = function(rfb, state) { ... }

#### RFB.onnotification

The `onnotification` event handler is fired when the `RFB` object wants
a message displayed to the user. **`msg`** is a `DOMString` specifying
the actual message, and **`level`** is a `DOMString` indicating the
severity of the message. The following levels are currently defined:

  - `"normal"`
  - `"warn"`
  - `"error"`

**`options`** is currently unused.

##### Syntax

    RFB.onnotification = function(rfb, msg, level, options) { ... }

#### RFB.ondisconnected

The `ondisconnected` event handler is fired when the connection has
been terminated. **`reason`** is `undefined` for a clean termination
and a `DOMString` specifying the reason in the event of an unexpected
termination.

##### Syntax

    RFB.ondisconnected = function(rfb, reason) { ... }

#### RFB.oncredentials

The `oncredentials` event handler is fired when the server requests
more credentials than were specified to [`RFB.connect()`](#rfbconnect).
The **`types`** argument is a list of all the credentials that are
required.

##### Syntax

    RFB.oncredentials = function(rfb, types) { ... }

#### RFB.clippingDisplay()

The `RFB.clippingDisplay()` method is used to determine if the
framebuffer is larger than the current canvas, i.e. it is being
clipped.

##### Syntax

    RFB.clippingDisplay( );

###### Return value

Returns a `boolean` indicating if the framebuffer is currently being
clipped.

#### RFB.requestDesktopSize()

The `RFB.requestDesktopSize()` method is used to request a change of
the framebuffer. The capability `resize` must be set for this method to

Note that this is merely a request and the server may deny it.
[`RFB.onfbresize`](#rfbonfbresize) will be called when the framebuffer
actually changes dimensions.

###### Parameters

**`width`**
  - A `long` specifying the new requested width in CSS pixels.

**`height`**
  - A `long` specifying the new requested height in CSS pixels.

#### RFB.viewportChangeSize()

The `RFB.viewportChangeSize()` method is used to change the size of the
canvas rather than the underlying framebuffer.

This method has no effect if `RFB.viewport` is set to `false`.

##### Syntax

    RFB.viewportChangeSize( width, height );

###### Parameters

**`width`**
  - A `long` specifying the new width in CSS pixels.

**`height`**
  - A `long` specifying the new height in CSS pixels.
